## Taxonomy Quality Aspects

The table below shows a taxonomy for image quality in second-hand marketplaces. The aspects are extracted from the justifications that both users and LLMs gave for providing a specific quality score.

| **Aspect Group**          | **Definition**                                                                           | **Aspects**                               | **Justification Examples**                                                                                                                                                    |
